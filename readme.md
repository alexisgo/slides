HTML5/CSS and JS slideshow with a bit of awesomeness

Viewers can takes notes by simply hitting the 4-key. Notes are stored in local storage, so are semi permanent.

Want text to come in incrementally?  add the class 'temphidden' to elements on a slide. Hitting the #2 will remove that class, one element per click.

Want to include a seperate page in your deck? add the class "object" to the slide. It will take up the width and height of the slide. If you want to link to an external resource, add <a href="link to source" class="objectlink"> and the link will be in the upper right corner of the slide.

Slides move back and forth with the arrow keys, unless you are in a contenteditable section (so that you can hit the space bar).
